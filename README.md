# Data Analysis and Linear Regression Using Python

## Overview
This project involves performing statistical analysis and regression modeling on a health dataset. The dataset contains information such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, body temperature, and heart rate, along with an associated risk level.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Age**
- **Systolic Blood Pressure**
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure**
- **Blood Sugar**
- **Body Temperature**
- **Heart Rate**
- **Risk Level**

## Features
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, range, skewness, and kurtosis to summarize the data.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Performing hypothesis testing using a one-sample t-test.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Calculating a 95% confidence interval for a selected feature.
- **Linear Regression**: Building and evaluating a linear regression model to analyze relationships between variables.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations such as histograms, heatmaps, and regression plots to explore and understand the data.

## Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- seaborn
